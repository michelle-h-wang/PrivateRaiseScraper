OID: 
 	 * 91.50 %
 
ISSUANCE AMOUNT: 
 	 * $1,464,000
 
TERM: 
 	 * 1 Year, 6 Months
 
COUPON: 
 	 * Prime Rate plus 4.75% per annum (Prime Rate = 5.25% as of 6/23/23), payable quarterly in cash or, at Issuer's option (and subject to a DIFFERENT Interest Rate [PIK Toggle] as well as the satisfaction of certain Equity Conditions related to the liquidity of the Common Stock issuable in connection with this transaction), in shares of Issuer's Common Stock

[ Common Stock-in-lieu-of-Cash Interest Payment ]

If the Issuer elects to satisfy the payment of any interest through the issuance of its Common Stock, (i) the Interest Rate used to calculate the interest due will be the Prime Rate PLUS 7.75% per annum (i.e., 3.0% per annum higher than the cash interest rate) AND (ii) such Common Stock will be valued at the then current Nominal Conversion Price).
 
PURCHASE PRICE: 
 	 * [ Nominal Variable Conversion Price ]Subject to certain Conversion Restrictions, the principal amount under the Note is convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying such principal amount by 130.0% and then dividing such product by a Nominal Conversion Price equal to 87.5% of the LOWEST daily volume-weighted average price of Issuer's Common Stock over the 7 trading days prior to conversion (subject to Anti-Dilution Protection).[ Effective Variable Conversion Price ]Since (i) the Notes were issued at a discount to the Face Amount of $915 for $1,000 in Face Amount (i.e., 91.5% of the principal amount) AND (ii) the principal amount will be multiplied by 130.0% to determine the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under an applicable conversion (i.e., the $915 issuance price will actually correspond with $1,300 in Face Amount being converted for purposes of determining the number of Conversion Shares, or approximately 70.385%  of such increased principal), the EFFECTIVE Conversion Price is equal to the EFFECTIVE Original Issue Discount Percentage (approximately 70.385%) of the Nominal Conversion Price, or approximately 61.587% of the LOWEST daily volume-weighted average price of Issuer's Common Stock over the 7 trading days prior to conversion (subject to Anti-Dilution Protection).[ Adjustment Upon Stock Combination Event ]If there occurs any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination recapitalization or other similar transaction involving Issuer's Common Stock (any such transaction, a "Stock Combination Event"), the Conversion Price (or, if the Conversion Price has been reset to a Variable Conversion Price, the Maximum Conversion Price) of the Preferred Stock will be REDUCED (but not increased) to equal 100.0% of the arithmetic average of the 5 lowest daily volume-weighted average prices of Issuer's Common Stock during the 20 trading days ending on and including the 16th trading day after the occurrence of the Stock Combination Event. 
 
HARD FLOOR PRICE: 
 	 * None

NOTE THAT the Form of Note provides for a NOMINAL "Floor Price" equal to $0.60 per share (which would be equal to an EFFECTIVE Floor Price of $0.4223 after taking into account the Original Issue Discount and the premium applied to the principal to determine the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes; HOWEVER, if any such Conversion Price is below the "Floor Price" Issuer will have to pay cash in lieu of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to effectively lower the Common Stock-equivalent price to below such Floor Price, and so the Notes are NOT deemed to be subject to a Hard of Soft Floor Price.
